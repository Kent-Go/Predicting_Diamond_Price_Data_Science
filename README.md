# Predicting_Diamond_Price_Data_Science

## Phase 1: Data Preparation & Visualisation
We defined the objective of our report, which is predicting the diamond's price in US dollars based on the available features provided in the diamond's dataset. Subsequently, we conducted data cleaning process by removing outliers which has a higher and lower carat than 1.5 times of the interquantile range, and identified if there any missing values occurs within the dataset. However, the dataset is complete thus not containing any missing value. Eventually, we visualised and explored the dataset using 15 figures that plot and illustrate the relationship between different variables using Seaborn and Matplotlib. An explanation is provided for each plot to analyse the patterns, correlations, and trends occured. Finally, comprehensive summary and conclusion are written to demonstrate the insights gained from Phase 1, and establish its connections with our objectives. References are added at the end to cite any dataset and information used in APA format as required.
Informations and analysis obtained from Phase 1 would contribute to further investigation on this multiple linear regression problem using statistical modelling to evaluate the relationship between a predictor variable and the response variable (price of diamond) while controlling the potential influence of other diamond's variables. This would assist in predicting the diamond's price strategically using its different variables in Phase 2.
